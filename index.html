  <p id="Art1"> Lovecraft was born in his family home on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island. 
    He was the only child of Winfield Scott Lovecraft and Sarah Susan (n√©e Phillips) Lovecraft.[2] 
    Susie's family was of substantial means at the time of their marriage, as her father, Whipple Van Buren Phillips, was involved in business 
    ventures.[3] In April 1893, after a psychotic episode in a Chicago hotel, Winfield was committed to Butler Hospital in Providence. 
    His medical records state that he had been "doing and saying strange things at times" for a year before his commitment.[4] 
    The person who reported these symptoms is unknown.[5] Winfield spent five years in Butler before dying in 1898. 
    His death certificate listed the cause of death as general paresis, a term synonymous with late-stage syphilis.[6] Throughout his life, 
    Lovecraft maintained that his father fell into a paralytic state, due to insomnia and overwork, and remained that way until his death. It is not known whether Lovecraft was simply kept 
    ignorant of his father's illness or whether his later statements were intentionally misleading.</p>

  <p id="Art2">Few of Lovecraft and Susie's activities between late 1908 and 1913 were recorded.[31] Lovecraft described the steady continuation of their 
    financial decline highlighted by his uncle's failed business that cost Susie a large portion of their already dwindling wealth.[32]
     One of Susie's friends, Clara Hess, recalled a visit during which Susie spoke continuously about Lovecraft being "so hideous that 
     he hid from everyone and did not like to walk upon the streets where people could gaze on him." Despite Hess' protests to the contrary, 
     Susie maintained this stance.[33] For his part, Lovecraft said he found his mother to be "a positive marvel of consideration".[34] 
     A next-door neighbor later pointed out that what others in the neighborhood often assumed were loud, nocturnal quarrels between mother and son, 
     were actually recitations of Shakespeare, an activity that seemed to delight mother and son.[35]
     During this period, Lovecraft revived his earlier scientific periodicals.[31] He endeavored to commit himself to the study of 
     organic chemistry, Susie buying the expensive glass chemistry assemblage he wanted.[36] Lovecraft found his studies were 
     stymied by the mathematics involved, which he found boring and would cause headaches that would incapacitate him for the 
     remainder of the day.[37] Lovecraft's first non-self-published poem appeared in a local newspaper in 1912. Called Providence in 2000 A.D., 
     it envisioned a future where Americans of English descent were displaced by Irish, Italian, Portuguese, and Jewish immigrants.[38] 
     In this period he also wrote racist poetry, including "New-England Fallen" and "On the Creation of Niggers", but there is no 
     indication that either were published during his lifetime</p>

  <p id="Art3">Lovecraft's earliest known literary works were written at the age of seven, and were poems restyling the Odyssey and other Greco-Roman mythological stories.[14] Lovecraft would later write that during his childhood he was fixated on the Greco-Roman pantheon, and briefly accepted them as genuine expressions of divinity, foregoing his Christian upbringing.[15] He recalled, at five years old, being told Santa Claus did not exist and retorted by asking why "God is not equally a myth?"[16] At the age of eight, he took a keen interest in the sciences, particularly astronomy and chemistry. He also examined the anatomical books that were held in the family library, which taught him the specifics of human reproduction that were not yet explained to him. As a result, he found that it "virtually killed my interest in the subject." </p> </p>

  <p id= "Art4" >As a result of the Great Depression, he shifted towards socialism, decrying both his prior political beliefs and the rising tide of fascism.[113] He thought that socialism was a workable middle ground between what he saw as the destructive impulses of both the capitalists and the Marxists of his day. This was based in a general opposition to cultural upheaval, as well as support for an ordered society. Electorally, he supported Franklin D. Roosevelt, but he thought that the New Deal was not sufficiently leftist. Lovecraft's support for it was based in his view that no other set of reforms were possible at that time </p>

  <p id="Art5"> Lovecraft was an atheist. His viewpoints on religion are outlined in his 1922 essay "A Confession of Unfaith". In this essay, he describes his shift away from the Protestantism of his parents to the atheism of his adulthood. Lovecraft was raised by a conservative Protestant family. He was introduced to the Bible and the mythos of Saint Nicholas when he was two. He passively accepted both of them. Over the course of the next few years, he was introduced to Grimms' Fairy Tales and One Thousand and One Nights, favoring the latter. In response, Lovecraft took on the identity of "Abdul Alhazred", a name he would later use for the author of the Necronomicon.[140] According to this account, his first moment of skepticism occurred before his fifth birthday, when he questioned if God is a myth after learning that Santa Claus is not real. In 1896, he was introduced to Greco-Roman myths and became "a genuine pagan". </p>
